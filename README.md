Used 6 molecular descriptors (molecular properties, information indices, 2D autocorrelations, atom-type counts, atom-type counts, 2D matrix-based descriptors) of 908 chemicals to predict acute aquatic toxicity (the concentration that causes death in 50% of test fish over a test duration of 96 hours) by fitting GBM (Gradient Boosting Machines) and GAM (Generalized Additive Models) in R; Cross validated MSE (Mean Square Error) of different models
